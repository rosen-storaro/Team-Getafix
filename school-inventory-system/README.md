### Manual Installation
If you prefer manual installation, see `INSTALL.md` for detailed step-by-step instructions.

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Configuration
The system uses a `.env` file for configuration. Key settings include:

```env
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=inventory_user
DB_PASS=your_secure_password

# Application Settings
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Security
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_character_encryption_key
SESSION_LIFETIME=3600

# Email Configuration (for notifications)
SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email@domain.com
SMTP_PASS=your_email_password
```

### Database Configuration
The system automatically creates three databases:
- `auth_db` - User authentication

2. **Change Password** (required on first login)
3. **Add Categories and Locations** for your inventory
4. **Add Inventory Items** with photos and details
5. **Create User Accounts** for staff and students
6. **Configure Notifications** for automated alerts

### User Roles
- **User**: Can browse inventory and submit requests
- **Admin**: Can manage inventory, approve requests, view reports
- **Super-admin**: Full system access, user management, sensitive item approval

### Workflow
1. **Users** browse available inventory and submit requests
2. **Admins** review and approve/decline requests
3. **Items** are marked as checked out when approved
4. **Users** return items with condition notes
5. **System** automatically updates inventory status and sends notifications
